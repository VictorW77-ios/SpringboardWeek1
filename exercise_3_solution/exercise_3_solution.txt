In my vimrc file:1. I set the command line history to store the previous 25 lines:set history = 25¬2. I enabled faster terminal update:set ttyfast¬3. Turned syntax highlighting on:syntax on¬4. Implemented Sam Agnew's (twilio) crosshair cursor function that allows for horizontal and vertical row/column highlighting. This function also alters pre-set crosshair settings in the vimrc file and uses the 'ctermbg' variable (available in the console version of Vim) to specify which color I want the terminal to be:hi CursorLine cterm = NONE ctermbg = 0¬hi CursorColumn cterm = NONE ctermbg = 0¬nnoremap <Leader>c :set cursorline! cursorcolumn!<CR>¬
